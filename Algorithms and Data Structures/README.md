# Algorithms and Data Structures
Most of these algorithms and data structures were implemented as part of labs in the course Algorithmic Problem Solving, TDDD95, at Linköping University.
Exercises were judged by the online judge Kattis, and as such all implementations either include or are accompanied by a main function doing I/O.

I took the course in parallel with the course Advanced Programming in C++, and was a bit torn between speedy C-like implementations with lot's of global variables and more elegant solutions using the standard library.
Maybe the C-like solutions were able to shave some milliseconds of results, but a year later I am much more happy to open up the more readable solutions.

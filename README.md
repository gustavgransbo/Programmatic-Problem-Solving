# Programmatic Problem Solving and Competitive Programming
I have loved programmatic problem solving since I first started programming.
I started solving problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) using Java back in 2011, and have since solved hundereds of small progremmatic challenges. 
In more recent years I have mostly switched to using Python or C++, and the online judges [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) ([Profile](https://open.kattis.com/users/gustav-gransbo)) and [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php), with Kattis being my favourite.

In this repository I will upload some of my solutions to more or less tricky problems. 
For starterts I will upload some of my more recent solutions, many of which I implemented as part of the course Algorithmic Problem Solving at Linköping University.

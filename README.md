# Programmatic Problem Solving and Competitive Programming
I have loved programmatic problem solving since I first started programming.
I started solving problems on Project Euler using Java back in 2011, and have since also used the systems Kattis and UVa.

In this repository I will upload some of my solutions to more or less tricky problems. 
For starterts I will upload some of my more recent solutions, many of which I implemented as part of the course Algorithmic Problem Solving at Linköping University.
